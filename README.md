# Task-Tracker
This Task Tracker is a simple, interactive web application that helps users manage tasks by organizing them into three categories: Tasks, In Progress, and Completed. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to move tasks between columns as they progress from start to completion.
