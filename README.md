# Task-Tracker

# Overview
This Task Tracker is a simple, interactive web application that helps users manage tasks by organizing them into three categories: Tasks, In Progress, and Completed. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to move tasks between columns as they progress from start to completion.

# Features
* Task Management: Add new tasks to the "Tasks" column, move them to "In Progress" as you work on them, and finally mark them as "Completed."
* Drag-and-Drop Interface: Seamlessly drag tasks between the "Tasks" and "In Progress" columns for easy management of your workflow.
* Task Editing: Quickly edit task descriptions directly from the "Tasks" or "In Progress" sections.
* Task Deletion: Mark tasks as completed by clicking the delete button. Completed tasks are moved to the "Completed" section and are disabled from further editing or moving.
*Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

# How to Use
* Add a Task: Enter a task description in the input field and click "Add Task" to create a new task in the "Tasks" column.
* Drag-and-Drop: Move tasks between "Tasks" and "In Progress" by dragging and dropping them into the desired column.
